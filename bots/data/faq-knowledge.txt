---

### **What is the Empowerment Challenge?**

The Empowerment Challenge is a structured personal development journey. It features daily tasks and weekly milestones to help users improve in areas like confidence, English speaking, and self-reflection. Participants earn points, build streaks, and unlock new tasks as they progress.

---

### **How do the daily tasks work?**

Each day includes two steps:

* **Check-In**: Share your plan or thoughts after reading the prompt
* **Check-Out**: Reflect on the day and submit your final answers

You must complete the Check-In before the Check-Out becomes available.

---

### **Can I skip days or do multiple tasks at once?**

No. Challenges follow a strict daily progression. You must complete todayâ€™s task before the next one unlocks. Skipping is not allowed to ensure long-term habit building.

---

### **What are Weekly Milestones and Sub-Milestones?**

Weekly Milestones are major goals for each week. Each one includes Sub-Milestones â€” smaller, trackable actions you can mark off during Check-Out. These help you measure real progress throughout the challenge.

---

### **How does the streak system work?**

Each time you complete both the check-in and check-out on a day, your streak increases.

* Skipping a full day resets your streak
* Your streak is shown on the dashboard (e.g., ðŸ”¥ 5-day streak!)
  This motivates consistency and daily engagement.

---

### **Are there rewards or incentives?**

Points are awarded for every completed task. While redeemable rewards are not yet available, a new incentive system is coming soon. This may include digital badges, coaching sessions, and other recognition for your effort.

---

Yes! Innovbridge is completely free to use. There are no hidden charges. Simply sign up with your email to start using the bots and joining challenges. The platform is built to empower â€” not monetize â€” the Burmese community.

---

Yes. The Innovbridge website is mobile-friendly. You can complete all challenges, use the bots, and track your progress from your smartphone browser without needing to install an app.

---

### **Do I need to finish all tasks every day?**

Youâ€™re encouraged to complete both the check-in and check-out to keep your streak going and earn full points. If you only complete one part, the day is not marked complete and wonâ€™t progress.

---

### **Who is Innovbridge built for?**

Innovbridge is ideal for Burmese learners in Singapore and beyond who want to improve their English, prepare for job opportunities, or build life skills â€” all at their own pace. Whether youâ€™re shy, busy, or just getting started, Innovbridge is made for you.

Why canâ€™t I see any current challenges?
You probably havenâ€™t joined one yet. To get started:

Go to Explore Challenges

Click on a challenge that interests you

Hit Join â€” it will now show up in your dashboard

Why are some Challenges locked?
We release the challenges in batches, one after another so do keep track of our annoucements for when the challenges release. 

Reload the page or try again after a few seconds

I checked in yesterday, but my streak didnâ€™t go up. Why?
Your streak only increases after both Check-In and Check-Out are completed for the same day. If you forget to check out, that day wonâ€™t count.

Can I return to a skipped day later?
No. Innovbridge uses a strict progression system. If you miss a day entirely (no check-in or check-out), itâ€™s considered skipped and cannot be redone. This is done so to encourage and train building a habit

Why is there no challenge in my dashboard even after i accepted a challenge?

Make sure you're on a mobile phone/view, as we've only developed the challenge system for mobile only. 

If issues persist, log out and back in or open a new page and try again

Iâ€™m stuck. Where can I get help?
If youâ€™re unsure what to do:

Use this FAQ Bot anytime

Visit the Bots tab and speak with the Coach Bot for motivation or Interview Bot for practice
